## Description of Experience
1. Beth, a pregnant woman, is recruited into the TERM program.
2. A nurse will meet with Beth for the first time.
3. In this first meeting, the nurse will begin developing a relationship with both her and her social support network.
4. Health and psychosocial assessments will be conducted.
    - These will be used as parameters for Beth's Maternal Health Plan (MHP) goals
5. A MHP is developed to satisfy her and her family's needs.
6. This MHP is integrated into her Electronic Health Record (EHR).
    - This enables better communication between Beth and her nurse, OB physician, and other specialists
7. The MHP is a word document that is updated after each home visit.
8. Beth can view this at anytime via the Patient Portal.
